To everyone,

My name is Scarlett. I got my Statistics and Economics degrees from University of California, Berkeley in 2016. After graduation, I worked for more than 2 years and mainly focused on data analysis and business analytics. I went back to school in 2019 for a Master's degree in Operations Research and graduate in May, 2020. I took many courses on AI, Machine Learning, NLP, database relations, etc. Meanwhile, I join an AI based AML Solution company's data science team. I'm preficient in common languages in the data science world like Python, R, SQL as well as tools like Git, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Numpy, etc.

My resume is attached. Feel free to contact me if you think I'm a good fit.

Thanks for taking time reading this.

Scarlett
