To everyone,

My name is Scarlett. I got my Bachelor of Art degrees(Statistics and Economics) from University of California, Berkeley in 2016. After graduation, I worked for more than 2 years and mainly focused on data analysis. Since I am very interested in working with data and Machine Learning, I went back to school in 2019 for a Master's degree in Operations Research and will graduate in May, 2020. I take many courses on AI, Machine Learning, NLP, etc and joins an AI company in fin-tech industry as data scientist intern. I'm preficient in common languages in the data science world like Python, R, SQL as well as tools like Git, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Numpy, etc.

My resume is attached. Feel free to contact me if you think I'm a good fit.

Thanks for taking time reading this.

Scarlett
