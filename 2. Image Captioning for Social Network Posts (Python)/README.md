## Image Processing and Hashtag prediction
1. This project aims to provide a solution to users who want to become social media influencers or simply want to share with specific groups with an easy-to-use product that can generate a list of hashtags based on the picture in less than 1 seconds. Users will no longer need to manually type out the hashtags. Instead, all they need to do is to upload the picture they would like to post to our product and select from the generated hashtags. The goal of our project is to not only save time for users by automatically generating hashtags but also target the most related audience by providing the most relevant hashtags.
